# 4 Ways to Hold Yourself Accountable to Your Goals

## - What is your **WHY**?

> You have to know your why... why is accomplishing this goal important to you? How will it ultimately improve your life? If you don't have a compelling enough answer for yourself, then you probably won't stick to it since it's not that important to you.

## - **PLAN** to make the **HABIT** a **PRIORITY**

> Making this study into a habit, into a priority will increase chance for success on this and future studies.

### - **ACCOUNTABILITY** Buddy

> This group is one source of accountability. Find more people you trust to share your goals with who can remind and encourage you when you're challenged.

### - Continually **EDUCATE** Yourself

> Learn the topic, learn how to learn, how to continually improve by sharing what you know!.
